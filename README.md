# LendingClub_EDA
LendingClub is one of America's leading destinations for online personal loans, usually an ideal method to borrow for a special need or credit card debt consolidation. It is well suited for people with responsible payment records and established financial histories.

LendingClub screens potential borrowers and services the loans once they’re approved. The risk: Investors – not LendingClub – make the final decision based on LendingClub grade, utilizing credit and income data. When a person applies online for a loan with LendingClub, there are two types of decisions taken:

* Accepted: There are 3 further possible scenarios described below based on the final output of the approved loan:

* Fully paid: Applicant has fully paid the loan (the principal and the interest rate)

* Current: Applicant is in the process of paying the instalments, i.e. the tenure of the loan is not yet completed.

* Charged-off: Applicant has not paid the instalments in due time for a long period of time, i.e. he/she has defaulted on the loan

* Rejected: Since the loan was rejected, there isn't a rich source of transactional, spending & behavioral patterns for these requests.

## Business Objectives:
In a finance industry, one of the main applications of data is to minimize without losing out on possible revenue. In this optimization exercise, the idea is to predict the customer risk i.e whether he will completely repay the loan with interest. If he doesn't, it is a financial risk for the lending party.

## Objective 
Objective is to identify the risky loan applicants at the time of loan application so that such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss. Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.
